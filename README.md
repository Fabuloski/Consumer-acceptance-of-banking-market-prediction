# Consumer-acceptance-of-banking-market-prediction

A bank marketing dataset relating to a Portuguese banking institution's direct marketing campaign (phone calls) was downloaded from UCI machine learning. We intend to use this data to predict if a client will subscribe to a term deposit. A term deposit is when a client agrees to lock away their money for an agreed length with a guaranteed interest return rate.

Download the banking marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
